# Random Password Generator - JS

In this project I was tasked to create an application that a user can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

#### The application must inlclude the following:

Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
- Length of password:
- At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
- Character types:
- Lowercase
- Uppercase
- Numeric
- Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
